// OUTPUT:
/*How To Make Environment For TypeScript.
   
DOWNLOAD Node.js First of all, download and install the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js for your operating system.
   
DOWNLOAD TypeScript Once Node.js is installed, open your terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and run the following command to install TypeScript globally: npm install -g typescript
   
DOWNLOAD VS Code Download and install Visual Studio Code from the official website.
   
HOW TO RUN CODE IN POWERSHELL
To run PowerShell as an Administrator, use the command: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   
SETUP A BASIC TYPESCRIPT PROGRAM
Now that you have Node.js, TypeScript, and VS Code installed, you can create a basic TypeScript program.
Open Visual Studio Code. Create a new folder for your TypeScript project and open it in VS Code. Inside the project folder, create a new file named index.ts.
   
WRITE A SIMPLE TYPESCRIPT PROGRAM
In index.ts, write a simple TypeScript program. For example:
let a = 'HELLO WORLD';
console.log(a);
Output:
HELLO WORLD
To compile and run the code, use the following commands:
1. tsc Filename.ts
2. node Filename.js
Congratulations! TypeScript is now set up on your system.
